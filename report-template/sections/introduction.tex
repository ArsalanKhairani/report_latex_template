Every new paragraph starts with an indentation of one tab space. The font is Regular 12-point Times New Roman and fully justified. The sections are numbered according to the number of Chapter.

\section{Figures and Tables}
There can be several sections within every chapter. The start of every section is indented (similar to paragraph). The number of sections depends upon the text. The sections are numbered according to the chapter number. For example for chapter 1, the sections are 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and so on. 

The figures and tables are also numbered according to chapter number and will be displayed as same on the list of figures and list of tables, if applicable. You can add an image as shown below and reference it as figure \ref{fig:sample_image}. To reference a figure caption and label are necessary \textbf{and in the same order}.
