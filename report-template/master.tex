% This template can be used as a to draft Final Year Project reports using LaTex.
% Created under the supervision of Dr. Muhammad Ali Ismail, Co-Chair CISD, NED, this
% provides a framework with all the necessary packages and formatting needed to provide a 
% quick start. That being said, it's also true that depending upon your needs, you
% might need to modify the template. Improvements to the templates are always welcomed,
% you can create a pull request to the Git repository mentioned above. I'll try to 
% comment the template as much as I can to explain the purpose of statements used and 
% how and what needs to be modified.

% Sidebar - Similar to programming, you can either create a very long single latex file with 
% all the imports and logic OR you can create multiple smaller modules. This template
% is constructed in modular format and thus this (the main file of the project) is very short.
% So let's get started!

% First step is to include all the packages (similar to programming). Like being said
% you could've done it in this file OR in some other file (like we did) and import it
% here. Check setup/preamble.tex for detailed description.
\input{preamble.tex}

% The latex document always starts with a begin{document} command and ends with end{document} command.
\begin{document}

  % front_page.tex is the cover page of hard binded book. It's according to the format
  % specified by NEDUET. However, to get it printed on a hard cover consult the binder.
  \input{sections/front_page.tex}
  
  % first_page.tex is the internal cover page.
  \input{sections/first_page.tex}
  
  % The next section contains things like abstract, acknowledgements, table of contents
  % etc. Note the use of pagestyle command, this command resets the header and footer
  % style so that the following pages doesn't get the header & footer like the main
  % content. In other words, we don't want page numbers on the following pages.
  % However, following the pagestyle statement, you'd see that we've used pagenumbering
  % command, this commands sets the format of page numbers. We need it here otherwise,
  % the following pages would get page numbers as well and though pagestyle can
  % make them disappear, we'd see those page numbers in table of contents.
  % Finally, the cleardoublepage command is to end the current page. Removing this
  % command could result in improper page numbering.
  \doublespacing
  \pagestyle{empty}
  \pagenumbering{roman}
  \input{sections/abstract.tex}
  \input{sections/acknowledgments.tex}
  \tableofcontents
  \listoffigures
  \listoftables
  \cleardoublepage
  
  % Here is the main content of the report. Note that we're now using fancy pagestyle
  % and also using the arabic numerals for page numbers.
  \pagestyle{fancy}
  \pagenumbering{arabic}
  \input{sections/introduction.tex}
  \input{sections/chapter_2.tex}
  
  % The final section of our report is bibliography. You can add you references in
  % bib/mybib.bib and they would automatically appear here, if cited.
  % The linespread{1} command is changing the linespacing to single space unlike the
  % rest of the document which is double spaced.
  \linespread{1}
  \printbibliography[heading=bibintoc,title={References}]
  \label{bib:mybiblio}
  
% And that's al1.
\end{document}
